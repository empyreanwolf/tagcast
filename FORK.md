# This fork: Artist cleanup

Based on Tagcast 0.85.1 (cyberdeliaAI/tagcast, MIT). Adds **Artist cleanup**:
merge duplicate artist entries, split combined names such as `Coldplay/BTS`, and
link guests named in titles such as `(feat. X)`. See `docs/artist-cleanup.md`.

## Run it on Windows

1. Install Python 3.11 or newer from python.org (tick "Add python.exe to PATH"), or uv.
2. Extract this folder anywhere, for example `Documents\tagcast-fork`.
3. Double-click **`start-tagcast-fork.bat`**. The first start installs Tagcast into
   a `.venv` folder next to it; later starts are quick. Your browser opens
   `http://127.0.0.1:8913`.
4. Sign in to iBroadcast as usual. The fork uses the same settings folder
   (`%USERPROFILE%\.tagcast`) as the official app, so an existing sign-in is reused.

The fork runs on port 8913 so it never reuses an official Tagcast already running
on 8912. Close the black window to stop it.

## Suggested order

1. Turn off **Combine Multi-Disc Album Sets** in iBroadcast.
2. **Search & merge** one tiny test first (for example `Lotus ` → `Lotus`), then check in
   the iBroadcast app that the old entry disappeared.
3. **Duplicates** → **Combined names** → **Featured in titles** → **Duplicates** again.
4. Export each report before preparing the next preview if you want to keep it.
